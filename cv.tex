\section*{Research Statement}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
&

I'm a PhD student at UT Austin fascinated by and passionate about intelligent tutoring systems and massive open online education.  In particular I want to match students with content based on aptitudes and preexisting understanding to target education to maximize student knowledge and engagement.
\\
&As educational data becomes massive and MOOCs are disrupting traditional institutions, it's time to find out new things about how people learn and replace frustrating, redundant and expensive experiences with those that are optimized, accessible and free.  I want to formulate questions about education as well-defined machine learning challenges, and use AI techniques to empirically evaluate pedagogy and cognitive-science-based hypotheses about learning and education.
\\
&I see this challenge as having two parts - first, being able to accurately identify trends and patterns in learning, and second, using evidence-based design and A/B testing to create more powerful learning experiences. I want to collaborate with course providers to generate and evaluate hypotheses about how students worldwide learn, so everyone can have an excellent education.
