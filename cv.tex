\section*{Research Projects}
\begin{tabular}{L!{\VRule}R}
	Currently& {\bf Time in Named Entity Disambiguation}\\
	& Guided by Dr. Jannik Str\"otgen, Dr. Johannes Hoffart, and Prof. Gerhard Weikum \\[0.1cm]
	& As a part of Master's thesis, currently working on improving the state of the art named entity disambiguation system, \href{https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/aida/}{AIDA}, leveraging temporal context. Additionally, working on to improve the overall system by computing  textual context similarity using word embeddings. \\ \\
	2016 & \href{http://tiwiki.mpi-inf.mpg.de}{\textbf{TIWIKI}}\\
	& In Databases and Information Systems Department led by Prof. Gerhard Weikum \\[0.1cm]
	& Developed a search engine for retrieving Wikipedia pages based on a query that can be augmented with temporal constraints. For a demo, click on the title\\\\
	2015 & {\bf Anaphora Resolution in the Context of Named Entities}\\
	& Guided by Prof. Rajeev Sangal, Director, IIT-(BHU), India\\[0.1cm]
	& As a part of Bachelorâ€™s thesis, developed an event type anaphora-antecedent resolution system. Further combined this work with the existing entity type anaphora resolution system and improved the overall performance by adding semantic features. Additionally, studied the importance of context in the task of anaphora resolution.\\\\
	2014 & {\bf Vocaber}\\
	& Developed an application to recommend a sentiment score ordered list of synonyms for selected words in a text.\\\\
